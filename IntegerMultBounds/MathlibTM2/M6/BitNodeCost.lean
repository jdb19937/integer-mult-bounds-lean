# The five-class node: children, moment and the closed recurrence

**Headline** (`five_class_node`): the five-class node is a finite program of 29 pieces on
`5W = 142080` roles; on arbitrary dirty streams it is the parent interchange `D_1` on every role
(`runNode_interchange`), and each class run changes a helper's host role only by the exchange on
the helper's slot, the helper restored in its final frame (`invoke_host`); its child list
realizes `fiveHistogram`, five times `bitHistogram`, so at weight `1/(5W)` the occurrence moment is
S2's and at most one at `1 - 10/5769`.

* `Piece.children`: every class run of a stage makes the word's paid frame changes, `localPaid`
  (S1), and every remainder piece makes one child per role of its pair whose remaining interval is
  nonempty, of its rank (`rank_remainder`).
* `five_variable_closed`: `VariableRecurrence.variable_closed_of_rank` for this child list at
  weight `1/142080`. The execution premises (child sizes, per-node cost) are the physical machine's
  and stay hypotheses.

**Scope: an upstream-conditional certificate.** This certifies upstream's PR589 accounting under
its idealization: each frame change is an exact partial swap priced as one child of its rank, and
the stage routes and helper charts are exact coordinate changes priced at nothing.
`five_variable_closed` takes the per-node cost as the hypothesis `hcost`, which only a machine
realizing the idealization discharges. No such machine is known. On the H-before-D tape each
port-dependent route costs interchanges, about `+0.49` on the moment against a slack of `0.0056`;
upstream's fixed-width routes act on cover-class labels, under obligations open upstream
(`M6/DESIGN.md`, "Realizability of the PR589 accounting"). These theorems give no physical
exponent.

/-- **The five-class node under upstream's idealization**, as one result. Frame changes are ideal
partial swaps priced as one child of their rank, and routes and charts are free. The result is
conditional on that idealization and gives no physical exponent; see the module docstring.
1. The five-class node is a finite program of 29 pieces on `5W = 142080` roles; each stage piece
   runs the invocation once per replica and class, 160 runs.
2. On arbitrary dirty streams it is the parent interchange `D_1` on every role, and in every class
   run a helper's host role changes only by the exchange on the helper's slot.
3. Its child list realizes five times `bitHistogram`.
4. At weight `1/(5W)` the occurrence moment is at most one at `1 - 10/5769`, so
   `five_variable_closed` applies at every `λ > 1 - 10/5769`. -/
